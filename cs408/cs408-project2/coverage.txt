Reasons for not 100% coverage:

- void stacktrace()
    Lines 141-142 not executed sometimes because they're there to catch errors that we can't predict (libunwind error).
    If we exclude this, and libunwind throws an error, it would crash the program.
    These are not guaranteed to execute always.

- void pthread_exit()
    The final curly brace is never covered because, on the line before, the original pthread_exit() function is called, which does not return.
