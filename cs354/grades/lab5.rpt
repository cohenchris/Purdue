Problem 4: 110/120
Comment: explicit kill(pid) doesn't do proper garbage collection for process begin killed (-10) because freemem clears list for currpid

Bonus: 13/20
Comment: Creative, but may not be enough.   Few methods provided by linux/gcc/windows/llvm:   Code-pointer integrity/seperation;  Address space layout randomization;  EncodeSystemPointer;  Control-flow integrity.  Relocation read-only;  Note Data Execution Prevention or Instruction-Set Randomization may not be enough
