preserves isolation/protection and, second, 
implement memory garbage collection so that when
a process terminates any memory not freed by the
process is returned to the kernel.

<h2>3. Asynchronous IPC with callback function (200 pts)</h2>

<h3>3.1 Overall implementation structure</h3>

<p>
This problem concerns implementation of asynchronous IPC with
callback function in XINU as discussed in class. 
A process registers
a user callback function with the kernel requesting that it be
executed on behalf of the process when a 1-word message arrives.
The callback function contains code written by the app programmer.
Although XINU does not implement isolation/protection, we will
adopt a design compatible for implementation in modern operating systems 
such as Linux and Windows that must ensure isolation/protection
is preserved when a kernel provides this service.
For example, in the traditional system call trap in Linux and Windows
using the software interrupt int (what we used in lab2), the instruction iret which returns
from a system call switches a
process from kernel mode back to user mode. In XINU where system calls
are regular C function calls, the instruction ret is used to return
to the caller from kernel mode to kernel mode since XINU processes
perpetually run in kernel mode. Modify the ROP-based run-time context
manipulation technique from Problem 4, lab4, to affect execution of
the callback function in the process's context (back in user mode in
Linux and Windows in case of iret) that registered the callback function
before ultimately returning to synchronous user code (i.e., user
code not asynchronously through callback functions)
so that the app process can continue where it left off.
The callback function takes on the role of quietmalware() in
Problem 4.3, lab4. 
</p>


<h3>3.2 Callback function registration and unregistration</h3>

<p>
The kernel exports a system call that
is used by an application to specify 
a user space callback function to be
executed in its context when a message is received. 
The callback function prototype is
</p><pre>syscall cbregister(void (* fp)(void), umsg32 *mbufptr)
</pre>
where fp is a function pointer to a user callback function and
mbufptr is a pointer to a 1-word message buffer.
The return value is SYSERR if registration failed, OK otherwise.
In our XINU implementation, registration fails if the system call
determines that fp does not lie in the address boundary of the text segment
and/or mbufptr points inside the text segment.
Check the nulluser() function in initialize.c which outputs segment
boundaries to determine how to do that.
A process registers a callback function (typically at the beginning of app code) using
<pre>   if (cbregister(&amp;usercb, bufpt) != OK) {
      kprintf("registration of %x failed\n", (uint32) usercb);
      userret();        /* proceeding with app code is nonsensical */
   }
</pre>
<p></p>
where userret() plays the role of exit() in Linux.

<p>
XINU remembers that a callback function has been registered by introducing five new
fields in the process table structure procent:
</p><pre>   bool8 prcbvalid;        /* Nonzero if callback function has been registered */
   void (* prcbptr)();     /* Pointer to callback function */
   umsg32 *prmbufptr;      /* Pointer to user space message buffer */
   umsg32 prtmpbuf;        /* Temporary message buffer */
   bool8 prtmpvalid;       /* Nonzero if temporary message buffer is non-empty */
</pre>
prcbvalid is a Boolean flag, prcbptr stores the callback function address, 
prmbufptr stores the user message buffer address, prtmpbuf is a temporary message
buffer, and prtmpvalid is a flag that indicates if the temporary message
buffer is non-empty. The role of prtmpbuf and prtmpvalid is explained in 3.5.
When a process tries to register a second callback function, cbregister() returns an
error indicating that registration has failed. That is, a process is allowed to register
only one callback function for asynchronous IPC. 
To register a different callback function, an app process
must first unregister the existing callback function by invoking the system call
<pre>syscall cbunregister(void)
</pre>
which sets the flag prcbvalid to be invalid and returns OK. If there was no registered
callback function, cbunregister() returns SYSERR.
<p></p>

<h3>3.3 Callback function usage</h3>

<p>
When a message arrives for a process that registered a callback function for asynchronous
IPC, the kernel copies the message to the process's user space message buffer. Then XINU
arranges for the callback function to be executed before the user process resumes normal
synchronous operation.
What the callback function does is up to the app programmer. An example
callback function is
</p><pre>   void usercb(void) {
   extern umsg32 ubuffer;

      kprintf("message is %d\n", ubuffer);
   }
</pre>
where ubuffer is the 1-word message buffer whose address has been communicated to the
kernel when invoking cbregister().
The kernel ensures that the callback function is executed in the process's
context (in user mode in Linux and Windows) that registered it to preserve isolation/protection.
Note that in this version of asynchronous IPC, for a process that has registered a
callback function the receive() system call must not be called since no message
will be stored in the receiver's 1-word message buffer prmsg in the process table.
Instead, the send() system call will copy a message directly to a message buffer
in user memory and arrange for the callback function to be executed when the
receiver process resumes synchronous execution.
<p></p>

<h3>3.4 Callback function execution in user context</h3>

<p>
<b>Overview</b>
When a 1-word message is sent to the receiver process that registered
a callback function -- in our uni-processor galileo backends this
implies that the sender process is the current process running on
the CPU -- XINU will not run the callback function in kernel context
borrowing the context of the sender process.
Nor will XINU run the callback function in the context of the
sender process since processes must be shielded from each other to
achieve isolation/protection.
Instead, XINU waits until its scheduler 
decides to context-switch in
the process that registered the callback function, call it the receiver
process.
Before resuming the receiver process's
execution where it left off, using ROP-based run-time process
context manipulation XINU will arrange a jump to the registered
callback function so that the callback function is executed in the
context of the process that registered it. In tandem, the 1-word
message is written to the receiver's message buffer whose address
communicated to the kernel through the cbregister() system call.
When the callback function completes, the kernel arranges for
a final jump so that the receiver process resumes where
it left off before it was context-switched out.
</p>

<p>
<b>Design</b>
The basic technique for injecting the callback function in the receiver process's
execution path at run-time is
the same as in Problem 4, lab4, albeit with a twist.
In Linux and Windows the return address to be manipulated
would be the one used by iret since it is at that point that the receiver process
switches from kernel mode back to user mode. Two scenarios are possible. A
system call was invoked that trapped from user mode to kernel mode, and iret
returns from kernel mode back to user mode. In the second scenario, an external
interrupt (e.g., clock) caused the current process that registered a callback
function to switch to kernel mode. While handling the interrupt in kernel mode
the process is context-switched out. For example, in the case of a clock interrupt
this would happen if the current process depleted its time slice and
the scheduler context-switched in a higher priority ready process.
In XINU, we also need to consider two cases: 
</p>

<p>
Case (i) <i>The receiver process was context-switched out
because it made a blocking
system call</i>. To focus on programming technique and reduce unnecessary complications, 
we will only consider applications that make sleepms() blocking system calls.
Other blocking system calls such as wait() in the kernel's upper half can be handled
in a similar manner.
Unlike Problem 4, lab4, where first we manipulated the return address of ctxsw() to
jump to malware code, in asynchronous IPC we
will manipulate the return address
of sleepms(). Although in XINU sleepms() is a regular function that does not trap
from user mode to kernel mode with hardware support (e.g., int instruction in lab2),
manipulating the return address of the ret instruction of sleepms() corresponds
to manipulation of the return address of iret had sleepms() been implemented to
perform a trap. That is, after executing ret from sleepms(), we are back in user
context where the process's callback function is executed which is consistent with
a kernel design that preserves isolation/protection.
The second jump we need to arrange is a jump from the callback function after it
completes back to the instruction in the receiver code to which sleepms() would
have originally returned to. Hence as in lab4, we need to arrange for two jumps.
The difference is that our target is not the return from ctxsw() but
sleepms(). Since these operations concern kernel code in the upper half, case (i)
concerns changes in run-time behavior of the upper half that pertain to
system calls.
</p>

<p>
Case (ii)
<i>The receiver process was forcefully context-switched out because it depleted its
time slice</i>. This means that a clock interrupt prompted execution of
clkdisp.S which, in turn, called clkhandler(). The latter manages time slice countdown
by calling resched() when preempt reaches 0. The moment the computing system
returns to user context of the receiver process is when iret of clkdisp is executed
after the receiver process is context-switched in, i.e., becomes current and
resched() returns to clkhandler() which, in turn, returns to clkdisp. The mechanisms
underlying iret we have already encountered when implementing trapped versions of
system calls getpid() and getprio() in lab2.
The return address of iret in clkdisp must be manipulated so that, as in case (i),
first we jump to the receiver's callback function, and second, upon completion of
the callback function the receiver process jumps back to the original return address
of iret in clkdisp.
Since these operations concern kernel code in the lower half, case (ii)
concerns changes in run-time behavior of the lower half that pertain to
external interrupts.
</p>

<h3>3.5 Implementation of return address manipulation</h3>

<p>
<b>Mods in send()</b>
Preparatory actions for
manipulation of the return address -- in case (i) ret from sleepms() and in case (ii) iret from
clkdisp -- must be done by send() when a message send event to a receiver that registered
a callback function occurs. XINU can
determine if case (i) or case (ii) applies by checking the receiver process's
state: PR_SLEEP implies case (i) and PR_READY implies case (ii). 
Manipulation of return addresses can be done in several ways. In this lab,
follow an approach that is direct and does not use wrapper functions.
In both case (i) and  case (ii), modify send() so that if the receiver of a message
has registered a callback function and has received a prior message for
which its callback function has not been executed yet, the newly sent message
is discarded. That is, only one asynchronous IPC message can be outstanding at
a time. The process table field, prtmpvalid, is initialized to 0, and set to 1
if a message to an asynchronous receiver arrives. The message is temporarily
stored in prtmpbuf. The last two
operations are the responsibility of send().
When the receiver process becomes current, the kernel copies
the content of prtmpbuf to the receiver's 1-word user space message buffer and
resets prtmpvalid to 0. The specifics of these steps are described for case (i)
and case (ii) separately.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mods in clkdisp</b>
First, case (ii). Modify clkdisp so that before enabling interrupts, restoring
the 8 general-purpose registers, and executing iret, 
clkdisp copies the content of prtmpbuf to the user
space message buffer and resets prtmpvalid to 0. Then comes the key step of
manipulating return
addresses so that the receiver's callback function is executed in user context.
That is, after executing iret. From lab2, recall that EFLAGS, CS, EIP were pushed
by x86 onto the receiver's run-time stack. XINU's clkdisp code is written so
that after popal ESP points to the stack location where EIP has been pushed.
What we will do is shift the content of the top three locations (in unit of word)
containing EFLAGS, CS, EIP "downward" by 1 word (i.e., 4 bytes). Downward means
toward lower memory which implies increasing the stack by 1 word. This frees up
the 1-word space in the stack where EFLAGS before the shift was located. Copy
into this location the pushed EIP at the top of the stack which is the original
return address of clkdisp. Note that ESP must be updated to reflect the growth
of the stack by one word. Lastly, replace the content at the top of the stack
which contains the original return address of iret with the address of the
callback function. Then enable interrupts and restore the x86 general-purpose
registers. iret will pop the top of the stack containing the callback function's
address into register EIP, pop the next two words from the stack and populate
CS and EFLAGS, at which point the stack pointer ESP will point to the original
return address of clkdisp. iret will have caused a jump to the callback function,
and when it returns upon completion, ESP will point to the original return address of
clkdisp so that upon executing ret in the callback function, the receiver
process resumes where it left off. The above is an outline and your task is 
to implement it and make it work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mods in sleepms()</b>
Case (i) differs from case (ii) implementation in that sleepms() is coded in C
and sleepms() uses ret, not iret, to return upon completion. Not using iret simplifies
coding since making a detour to the callback function and jumping to the original
return address upon completion may be done by C code inserted at the end of sleepms().
Note that for system calls in Linux and Windows that trap from user mode to kernel
mode, an approach similar to case (ii) must be followed for case (i).
</p>

<p>
Test your design and implementation using sender and receiver processes.
This includes sending of multiple messages by a single sender and multiple
sender processes, and checking the messages received by the receiver process. 
You do not need to consider the case where a process registers a callback
function and, then, calls receive().
Since only one asynchronous IPC message for a receiver can be outstanding,
process priority and scheduling will influence if messages are dropped or
not. Also, no blocking system calls are allowed from within callback
functions. Use the code from lab1 as your base code where using fixed process 
priority and time slice that you can configure, 
correctness of your implementation can be more readily evaluated.

<h2>4. Memory garbage collection (120 pts)</h2>

<h3>4.1 Overview</h3>

<p>
XINU uses getmem() to allocate heap memory from a single
linked list of free memory segments and freemem() to return
unused memory to the free memory pool. The kernel keeps track of
per-process stack memory so that when a process terminates its stack
memory is returned to the free memory list via freestk().
This is not the case, however, for memory allocated by
getmem() which gets only freed if a process explicitly
deallocates memory by calling freemem() which is
voluntary. 
That is, when a process terminates any dynamic memory that was
allocated but has not been freed remains allocated. Examine kill() which is
called to terminate a XINU process.
Even when an application programmer
ardently tries to free allocated memory before exiting,
programming mistakes
and bugs that prematurely terminate a process
may result in build-up of memory that is not returned to the free
list upon termination. This is one form of memory garbage.
</p>

<p>
Garbage collection aims to free allocated memory -- in general, while 
a process is still running -- when it can be ascertained that a process
does not need the memory anymore, i.e., all references/pointers to the
memory have been deleted. We are tackling a more modest problem of
ensuring that all memory allocated to a process through getmem(),
whether freed by a process or not, are reclaimed by XINU when the process terminates.
This eliminates memory leakage by injecting
garbage collection support inside the kernel. 
To do so, XINU must track
dynamic memory allocation and deallocation on a per-process basis 
and return any unfreed memory 
to the free list 
when a process terminates through kill().
</p>

<h3>4.2 Per-process memory block list</h3>

<p>
Design and implement garbage collection support
in XINU by modifying the system calls
getmem(), freemem(), kill(), and other relevant parts
of the kernel to eliminate memory leakage.
For simplicity, assume that freemem() is always called by
app code so that its first argument is a pointer returned 
by getmem() and the second argument is the memory size
requested by getmem(). That is, freemem() behaves similar
to free() in Linux where it takes a memory pointer as
its sole argument. Add a new field to the process table
</p><pre>   struct inusememblk *prheaphd;      /* Header node of allocated memory list */
</pre>
where the struct inusememblk
<pre>   struct inusememblk  {                     
	char    *memblockptr;           /* Ptr to in-use memory block */
	uint32  memlen;			/* Size of memory allocated (multiple of 8 bytes) */
        struct  inusememblk  *mnext;    /* Ptr to next list element  */
   };
</pre>
is used to keep track of in-use (i.e., allocated) memory blocks. Define inusememblk
in include/memory.h.
prheaphd points to a list that keeps track of all
memory blocks allocated to a process using getmem() but not freed
using freemem(). 
prheaphd-&gt;memblockptr contains the address of the first in-used memory block
(null if no heap memory is in-used by the process),
and prheaphd-&gt;mnext points to the next
element in the memory block list. 
memlen specifies the size of the allocated memory block rounded up to be
a multiple of 8 bytes.
This per-process memory block
list is a priority list whose elements are sorted in increasing order
of memblockptr. Code an internal kernel function with function prototype
<pre>   void meminsert(struct inusememblk *hdptr, char *memptr);
</pre>
where hdptr points to the header node of a process's memory block list and
memptr is a pointer to a memory block to be allocated. 
Write a counterpart of meminsert()
<pre>   void memextract(struct inusememblk *hdptr, char *memptr);
</pre>
that deletes a list element whose memblockptr equals memptr.
<p></p>

<p>
Memory for a process's memory block list is dynamically
allocated using getmem() in meminsert(). However, since a process's memory
block list is part of kernel memory, it is not included in the
process's memory block list. Since memextract() is kernel code and
is assumed to be correctly coded -- i.e., calls freemem() when a process's
memory block list element is deleted -- memory leakage from kernel
code is not a concern.
To exclude memory allocated for a process's memory block list,
getmem() needs to know if it was called from meminsert(). In a similar
vein, freemem() needs to know if it was called from memextract().
To do so, define a global variable, bool8 memblockkflag, that is initialized
to 0. memblockkflag is set to 1 when getmem() is called from
meminsert(). Similarly for freemem() from memextract(). If so,
getmem() and freemem() reset the flag to 0 before returning.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Testing</h3>

<p>
Evaluate your garbage collection enabled XINU kernel on 
test cases where app programs omit freemem() system
calls but garbage collection ensures that the unfreed
memory is reclaimed when processes terminate.
Assume that freemem() will always be correctly invoked, i.e.,
with the first argument being a pointer returned by getmem().
</p>

<h2>Bonus problem [20 pts]</h2>

<p>
In Problem 4, lab4, an attacker modified the return address of ctxsw()
to jump to its malware code which then behaved overtly or covertly depending on the
attacker's objective. In the bonus problem, consider mounting a defense in the
context of XINU running on galileo backends subject to the attacker of lab4. The
solution cannot use a canary to detect corruption since return address overwrite
was performed surgically without collateral corruption of surrounding memory. Instead, think about
a ROP based defense where kernel code is modified to check if the return address
of ctxsw() (and similarly for resched() and sleepms()) is valid, i.e., safe to jump
to, and does so
only if it is. Perhaps a modified return address may even be corrected to
its original value so that jumping is feasible despite an attack.
Describe a detailed solution in Lab5Answers.pdf in lab5/. There is no need to
implement your solution.

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>

<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>
