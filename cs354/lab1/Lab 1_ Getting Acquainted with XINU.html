<h2>3. Inspecting XINU's run-time environment [165 pts]</h2>

<p>
Follow the instructions in the
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/xinu/xinu-setup.html">XINU set-up</a>
which compiles the XINU source code on a frontend machine (Linux PC)
in the XINU Lab, grabs an unused x86 Galileo backend machine,
loads and bootstraps the compiled XINU image. Note that the frontend
PC's terminal acts as a (remote) console of the dedicated
backend Galileo x86 machine. If XINU bootstraps successfully,
it will print a greeting message and start a simple shell
called xsh. The <i>help</i> command will list the set of commands
supported by xsh. Run some commands on the shell and follow
the disconnect procedure so that the backend is released.
<b>Do not hold onto a backend: it is a shared resource.</b>
</p>

<h3>Problem 3.1 (45 pts)</h3>

<p>
(a) Inside the system/ subdirectory, you will find the bulk of relevant
XINU source code. The file start.S contains assembly code
that is executed after XINU loads on a backend. After
performing bootstrap/initialization chores (the details are
not relevant at this time), a call to function nulluser()
in initialize.c is made. At some point, nulluser() calls
sysinit() (also in initialize.c). Jump to the code of sysinit()
where updates to the data structure proctab[] are made which
represents XINU's process table. In XINU, as well as in Linux/UNIX
and Windows, a process table is one of the key data structures
of an operating system where bookkeeping of all created
processes is performed. In our Galileo x86 backend which has
a single CPU, only one process can occupy the CPU at a time.
In a x86 machine with 4 CPUs (i.e.,
quad-core) up to 4 processes may be running concurrently.
Most of XINU's kernel code can be found in system/ and include/ (header files).
Some configuration related parameters can be found in config/.
The total number of processes supported in XINU is defined by the
constant NPROC. Do some detective work to locate the places where
NPROC is defined. Based on what you find, determine how many processes
can exist in XINU.
</p>
<p>
(b) When a backend machine bootstraps and performs initialization,
there is as yet no notion of a "process." That is, the hardware 
just executes a sequence of machine instructions compiled by
gcc on a frontend Linux PC for our target backend x86 CPU (i.e.,
the binary xinu.xbin). This
includes machine code translated from initialize.c. nulluser()
in initialize.c calls sysinit() which
sets up the process table data structure proctab[] which keeps
track of relevant information about created processes that have
not terminated. When a process terminates, its entry is freed
in proctab[]. After allocating the proctab[] data structure to
hold up to NPROC processes, sysinit() creates the first process,
called the NULL (or idle) process. This NULL process which exists
not only in XINU but also in Linux/UNIX and Windows is the
ancestor of all other processes in the system. It is the only
process that is not created by the system call create() but is
"handcrafted" during system initialization.
Locate where the constant NULLPROC is defined and determine its value.
One of the properties of a process is its priority. In XINU, the
larger the priority value (an integer) the higher preference a process is
given during scheduling when the kernel decides which process to
allocate a CPU next. Using detective work, determine the C type of
of the priority field in the process table of XINU. Do not just
provide the final answer but describe the procedure you followed to
arrive at the answer. Specify the maximum and minimum priority values,
at least in principle, that a XINU process may take.
Where in this range does the priority of the NULL process fall?
</p>
<p>
(c) At some point, nulluser() calls create() where the first
argument, <i>startup</i>, is a function pointer to startup() whose code
is contained in
initialize.c. System call create() finds a free entry in proctab[] and
creates a new process. In XINU, all processes created using create()
start off in a suspended state which means they are not assigned to the CPU.
The system call resume() changes the state of a newly created process
to a ready state which allows it to compete with other ready processes
for CPU cycle allocation. In our version of XINU, the only task
performed by startup() is to create (and resume) a process running the
function main() whose code is in main.c. Since creating a process running
startup() adds overhead, create a process that runs main() from
nulluser() directly. This will be your first modification of XINU which
changes the source code in initialize.c. 
When making changes to source
code, it is good practice, even if changes are minor, to annotate the
code using comments what was done, by whom, when. Follow this practice
when making mods to XINU. After making the change to nulluser(), verify
that it works correctly. Any time changes to XINU or application processes
running under XINU are made, XINU must be rebuilt on a front-end
machine and reloaded on a backend machine. The process running main()
prints a number of messages using kprintf() and then creates a process
running a shell app using create(). Except in lab1, we will have no
use for the shell app (it is just an application and not part of the
kernel) nor the kprintf() messages at the start of main().
</p>

<h3>Problem 3.2 (20 pts)</h3>

<p>
Remove the
"Hello World!" welcome message that is output on console by main().
Instead, write a function, void mymotd(void), in mymotd.c under system/ which
outputs using kprintf() a hello message containing your user name and name.
Make a call to mymotd() from nulluser() just before it creates a process
running main().
Since now you have added code residing in a new file, mymotd.c, under system/, the question
arises as to whether changes need to be made to Makefile in compile/.
In earlier versions of Makefile, new code files needed to be explicitly specified. In
the current version, all files in system/ are automatically
compiled and linked during a build. Verify that the mod works correctly.
In lab assignments where new functionalities are added
to XINU, this will entail adding files containing C and assembly code to system/
and header files to include/.
</p>

<h3>Problem 3.3 (40 pts)</h3>

<p>
(a) In Linux/UNIX, to create a new process that runs an
executable binary, say, /bin/ls, we first use the system call fork() to create a child
process and then call the system call execve() with /bin/ls (or a.out) as an argument.
As noted in Problem 3.1(c),
in XINU a newly created process is put in a suspended state after
it is created using create(). That is, the child process exists as an entry in the process table
but it is marked as suspended (constant PR_SUSP in include/process.h). 
Being in suspended state has the consequence that XINU will not assign CPU
cycles to the process until its state is changed to ready (PR_READY) by calling resume().
Two steps are needed to put a process into ready state so that XINU (i.e., its scheduler)
eventually allocates CPU cycles to the process. The first step is to set the state of the
process to PR_READY. The second step is to insert the process into a data structure called
a ready list where other ready
processes who are waiting to receive CPU cycles are kept. Both steps are performed by the kernel
function ready(). ready() is not a system call but
a kernel function that is called by system calls and other
kernel functions.
</p>
<p>
Inspecting the code of resume() will show that it calls ready() after performing
sanity checks to verify that the PID of the process to be resumed is valid and that
the process in question is indeed in suspended state. Otherwise, an error status
(value SYSERR) is returned. If resume() does not encounter a problem, it returns the
priority of the readied process.
The code of ready() shows that it changes the process state to
PR_READY, calls kernel function insert() to add the newly readied process
into XINU's ready list, and calls the kernel function
resched() which determines if the CPU should be assigned to a different ready
process. For example, if the just readied process has a higher priority
than the current process occupying the CPU, then by the preference rule noted
in Problem 3.1(b), the higher priority process is assigned the CPU and the
current occupant is removed. That is, a context-switch is performed.
</p>

<p>
Code a modified version of create(), pid32 rcreate(), with the same arguments as
create() which puts the newly created process in ready state. To do so, at the end
of create() just before calling restore(mask) (we will discuss the role of
restore() separately), make a call to ready(). Do not call
resume() from create(). Put the function rcreate() in
rcreate.c under system/. Check that rcreate() works correctly.
For example, instead of nulluser() calling 
<br><br>
resume(create((void *)main, INITSTK, INITPRIO, "Main process", 0, NULL));
<br><br>
it should suffice to call
<br><br>
rcreate((void *)main, INITSTK, INITPRIO, "Main process", 0, NULL);
<br><br>
rcreate() changes the flavor of XINU process creation to resemble the approach followed
by Linux/UNIX and Windows where newly created processes are not suspended.
</p>

<p>
(b) In Linux where a child process is created using fork(), the question arises as to
who runs first: child or parent? Experimentally gauge an answer to the question
by writing and running test code on a front-end Linux machine in the XINU Lab where 
the parent process forks a child process. Make them perform tasks after fork() such
as writing to terminal (file descriptor 1) using the write() system call.
Output the priority of the parent and child processes by calling
getpriority(). This helps gauge how Linux sets the priority of a child process. 
Keep in mind that a number of properties of the parent are inherited or shared by
child processes.
Also note that in Linux smaller integers mean higher priority.
Do not try to find an authoritative answer from books or other formal sources.
The point of this exercise is for you to experiment. For this task, it does not matter if
your experiments lead to an incorrect conclusion.
Put your test code, parentchild.c, in lab1/.
In the rcreate() version of create() in XINU, which process will run first after
rcreate() is called when the process running main() is created in 3.3(a)?
Use detective work to find the definitive answer without relying on experimental
evidence alone. This is different from the Linux exercise.
Keep in mind the rule: if two processes are ready, the kernel
picks one with higher priority. The case when priorities are
equal will be discussed separately.
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.4 (30 pts)</h3>

<p>
When your XINU code running on a backend machine triggers a hardware interrupt, x86 is
programmed by XINU to call interrupt handlers, mostly coded in assembly, in intr.S. For example,
a divide-by-zero arithmetic operation is detected by the hardware as interrupt number 0
(interrupts are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 255) and x86 proceeds to consult a table
called IDT (interrupt descriptor table) set up by XINU 
during initialization which specifies which interrupt handler to run.
The same goes for Linux/UNIX and Windows.
Interrupts that are generated as a result of the running program such as dividing by zero
are called synchronous interrupts. "Synchronous" means that the currently running program
caused the interrupt. In many cases, interrupts are asynchronous in the sense that their
cause lies elsewhere such as a clock ringing, a message arriving, among other events.
Intel uses the jargon "exception" or "fault"
to denote the first 32 interrupts which are all of synchronous type. They include the familiar
segmentation violation/fault which maps to interrupt, i.e., exception (or fault) number 13 that is 
triggered when a running program tries to reference memory that it does not have access 
to. The interrupt is synchronous to the instruction executed by the current process which
caused it. Exception 13 is also called General Protection Fault.
</p>

<p>
Interrupt handling code for interrupt number 0 (i.e., divide-by-zero) is located
at label _Xint0 in intr.S. The interrupt handling code for exception number
0 is just 7 lines of assembly code. 
The last instruction, jmp Xtrap, is an unconditional
jump/branch to Xtrap which contains 2 lines of code. The first instruction, call trap,
is a function call from assembly code intr.S to C function trap() in evec.c.
Thus the initial part of interrupt handling is coded in assembly and the latter
part in C. Inspect the trap() function code in evec.c. When doing lab assignments,
you will become enemy, and then friends, with code in intr.S and evec.c.
In particular, a bug in your XINU code is likely
to eventually end up as a call to trap(). 
The code in trap() 
prints select system state information that may help you track down bugs.
trap() is passed two arguments by its caller Xtrap with help from
assembly code at _Xint0 in intr.S. Explain how passing of the two arguments
is accomplished following (i.e., being consistent with) the CDECL convention.
Note that code in evec.c is translated in machine code by gcc. The code
in intr.S that is translated into machine code by the assembler. They must
interface correctly to work correctly. Modify trap() to print your user name,
name, and the XINU system variable clktime which is a global variable that
keeps track of the number of seconds that have passed since you bootstrapped
XINU on a backend machine. 
Trigger interrupt 0 by performing divide by zero
at the beginning of main(). Confirm that the system reaches the code in trap().
The last operation that trap() performs is to call the kernel function
panic(). Based on the code your find in panic(), explain what happens to
XINU at the end dividing by zero in an app generates interrupt 0.
</p>


<h3>Problem 3.5 (30 pts)</h3>

<p>
In Problem 3.4, we considered what happens to a process and XINU as a system
when interrupt 0 is generated in x86 by executing a divide by zero instruction.
In this problem we will consider what happens if a process does not generate
a synchronous interrupt and terminates by completing its last instruction. Informally
we would say that a process terminates normally. For
example, in the case of a process created using create() and running function
main(), we are interested in determining what happens after main() returns. In
XINU, there is nothing special about main() -- it is just another function --
and a process can be created to run any function. We are interested in 
determining what happens when this arbitrary function returns as a result of
completing the last instruction to be executed by the process. Keep in mind
that XINU is compiled using gcc and follows the CDECL function call convention.
</p>

<p>
To answer this question, we have to look at how the create() system call creates a
new process which entails myriad tasks. When looking at create(), in the example
where the function pointer of main() is passed as first argument of create(), we find 
that XINU creates the illusion that main() was called by another function
by pushing the function pointer (i.e., address) of this virtual calling
function onto the stack of the process running main() as the return address of main().
Looking at the code of create() where content is pushed onto the run-time stack of
a process when it is created, determine the name of the function that XINU sets up
as the function that called main(). Inspect the code of this virtual caller in
system/ and determine what it does. In the special case where the process that terminates
is the last process outside the NULL process, determine what happens by continuing
to follow XINU's source code. In the chain of functions being called starting with
the virtual function to which main() returns, what is the last function that is
called, where is its source code, and what does it do? In environments where power
consumption is an important issue -- e.g., battery powered mobile devices, or cloud
computing servers where overheating must be prevented -- is XINU's approach to
"shutting down" after the last process has terminated a good solution? What might be
a better solution? Explain your reasoning.

<h2><b>Bonus problem</b> [15 pts]</h2>

<p>
In Linux/UNIX system programming, we say that the fork() is special in that it
is the only system call that "returns twice." What does that mean? Why does this
feature of fork() not apply to XINU's create()? We say that Linux/UNIX's execve()
system call is special in that it is the only system call that does not return
when it succeeds. What does this mean? Why does this not apply to XINU's create()?

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>

<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>

<p>
If you are unsure what you need to submit in what format, consult the
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sashutos/ta-notes.html">TA Notes</a> link.
If it doesn't answer your question, send email to all four GTAs.
</p>

<p>
Specific instructions:
</p>

<p>
1. Format for submitting written lab answers and kprintf() added for 
testing and debugging purposes in kernel code:
</p><ul>
<li>
Provide your answers to the questions below in Lab1Answers.pdf and
place the file in lab1/. You may use any document editing software
but your final output must be exported and submitted as a pdf file.
</li>
<li>
For problems where you are asked to print values using kprintf(), use
conditional compilation (C preprocessor directives #define combined with #if and #endif)
with macro XINUTEST (in include/process.h) to effect
print/no print depending on if
XINUTEST is defined or not. For your debug statements, do the same with macro XINUDEBUG.
