<h2>3. Blocking send() IPC [120 pts]</h2>

<p>
This problem concerns the implementation
of a blocking version of send(), bsend(), which has
the same function definition as send(). The difference
is that if the receiver's buffer is full, bsend() blocks
until the receiver's buffer frees up. This is in
contrast to send() which returns immediately with
SYSERR indicating that sending has failed. Use your
code from lab1 as the code base. Put bsend() in 
system/bsend.c.
</p>


<h3>3.1 Kernel modifications: bsend()</h3>

<p>
For send() to behave in blocking mode means, first,
if the receiver's 1-word message buffer is empty, it behaves the same
way as send(). That is, send() copies the message to
the receiver buffer, sets the receiver's prhasmsg flag to 1, and returns OK
without blocking.
Second,
if the receiver's buffer is full, bsend()
blocks until the receiver's buffer becomes free. To block upon attempting to
send means that the sender's state changes from current to PR_SND
(define PR_SND as 11 in include/process.h).
The kernel records the message to be sent in a new 1-word process table field, umsg32 prsndmsg.
</p>

<p>
Before calling resched() to context-switch out the sender and context-switch
in a different process,
the sender is inserted into a FIFO queue of processes blocking to send to the
same receiver. To do so, we need to provide each process with a private FIFO queue
in case it becomes a receiver process to whom other processes
attempting to send messages block. Increase NQENT in include/queue.h to accommodate
per-receiver process blocked sender queues. Explain in Lab4Answers.pdf why your
change of NQENT works. Confer Chapter 4 of the textbook for a discussion of
how XINU implements queues.
Define two additional process table fields
</p><pre>   bool8 prsenderflag;            /* Set to 1 if one or more processes are blocking to send */
   qid16 prblockedsenders;        /* Index to FIFO queue of blocked senders */
</pre>
where prsenderflag is true if one or more processes are blocking to send,
0 otherwise.
prblockedsenders is an index to a FIFO queue of blocked sender
processes which must be initialized in create().
Use XINU's enqueue() and dequeue() functions for implementing
FIFO queues for managing the per-process blocked sender queues.
In XINU, a process can be resident in only one queue (e.g., sleep queue, ready list)
which affords space efficient queue management using the kernel data structure queuetab[].
<p></p>

<h3>3.2 Kernel mods: receive()</h3>

<p>
When a process makes a receive() system call,
receive() checks if it has a message in its 1-word buffer
by inspecting the prhasmsg flag. If prhasmsg is 0,
the receiver blocks. In the case prhasmsg is true,
before the 1-word message is returned by receive(),
the kernel must check if there are any blocker sender
processes. If
prsenderflag is 1,
one or more sender processes are waiting in the receiver's blocked sender FIFO queue.
Using dequeue() the process at the front of the queue is extracted and inserted into the
ready list. The dequeued sender's
message is copied from the sender's prsndmsg process table field to the 
receiver's prmsg 1-word buffer. Use of the local variable msg prevents
the previous message (which hasn't been returned yet) from being overwritten.
The receiver's prhasmsg flag remains 1. Lastly, the previous message
stored in msg is returned by receive().
Note that in our version of receive(), the scheduler is only called when
the receiver blocks because its 1-word message buffer is empty. Even in the case
where an unblocked sender process has higher priority than the receiver process,
the receiver process will remain current and execute the instruction following
the receive() system call. That is, we do not preempt a process making a receive()
system call if its message buffer is not empty. This comes at the cost of
potentially delaying execution of a high priority process which just became ready
after blocking in a receiver process's blocked sender queue. The benefit is
reduced overhead as resched() is not called before executing ret from receive().
In the case the just unblocked sender has lower priority than the receiver,
the resched() call would have been pure overhead.
</p>

<h3>3.3 Testing</h3>

<p>
Test your kernels mods for implementing bsend(). Describe in Lab4Answers.pdf what
test scenarios you have considered to gauge correctness.

<h2>4. Hijacking a process by modifying its run-time stack [120 pts]</h2>

<h3>4.1 Basic idea</h3>

<p>
An important technique for modifying the run-time behavior of a process is ROP (return-oriented
programming) which we utilized in Problem 3, lab3, to make a process execute code that it
wasn't programmed to do. By modifying the return address pushed onto the stack of
a newly created process, we induced it to make a detour to code that took time stamps to
commence CPU usage measurement. In this problem, we will use the same technique to
"hijack" a process by making it execute malware code. We will do so by modifying the
run-time stack of a victim process while it is context-switched out so that when it eventually
becomes current we induce ctxsw() to jump to the attacker's malware code. In the first
attack, the attacker makes ctxsw() jump to malware function hellomalware() which prints
a hello message and terminates the victim process. The attacker makes no effort to hide
the attack. In the second attack, the attacker makes ctxsw() jump to its malware function
quietmalware(). Instead of printing a message and terminating the victim process,
quietmalware() surgically modifies the victim process's data -- a local variable in
the app code -- then returns to resched() as if nothing had happened. The victim process
will continue to execute, but when printing the value of the local variable, it will
have been corrupted unbeknownst to the victim. Use your code base from lab1 but set
QUANTUM to be 30 msec.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Overt attack [60 pts]</h3>

<p>
Spawn three app processes from main() back-to-back using create()/resume(), all running
victimA(). This is followed by creation and resumption from main() of an attacker process
which runs attackerA(). Assign all four processes equal priority, albeit less than that of
the parent process running main(). 
</p>

<p>
<b>Victim process.</b>
The app code victimA() in system/victimA.c is given
by
</p><pre>void victimA(void) {
  int x;

  x = 5;
  kprintf("before funcA: %d %d\n", getpid(), x);
  sleepms(300);
  kprintf("after funcA: %d %d\n", getpid(), x);
}
</pre>
Creating and resuming the three app processes will result in the expected output
of a process's PID and integer value 5, twice per process. This is in the absence of
interference by the attacker process. Verify normal operation when the attacker
process does nothing.
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Attacker process.</b>
The attacker process runs, void attackerA(int y), in system/attackerA.c which works
as follows. The attacker chooses its victim's PID as getpid() - y. For example, if y = 1 then
the victim is the third app process created by main(). To stage a successful attack, the
attacker is assumed to be privy to certain knowledge such as the victim process being
in sleep state. The attacker is assumed to have access to the kernel's process table
which allows it to know the address of the top of the victim's run-time stack by looking
up prstkptr. With knowledge of how XINU's context-switch works, the attacker finds the
address at which the return address of ctxsw() (which returns to its caller resched())
has been pushed. Explain in Lab4Answers.pdf how you determine this address. The attacker
then overwrites the return address with the address of void hellomalware(void) (in
system/hellomalware.c). When the victim process eventually wakes up and becomes current,
it will continue to execute the "second half" of ctxsw() that pops the victim's stack
to restore register contents and returns to resched(). However, since the return
address has been modified to contain the function pointer of hellomalware(), the victim 
process jumps to hellomalware() which outputs a suitable message (e.g., "successful takeover")
and terminates the victim process.
</p>

<p>
<b>Testing.</b>
Verify that the attacker code works as intended by running tests without the attacker as
a reference point, followed by attacks with different values of argument y. For example,
for y = 3, the first app process spawned by the process main() should not return from
sleepms() to victimA() and, hence, not get to output the second kprintf(). The second and
third app processes should run as before.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Stealth attack [60 pts]</h3>

<p>
Hackers may opt for overt attacks in some cases. In others, a more stealthy mode may be 
employed to leave a victim in the dark about having been attacked.
Code a stealth attack, void attackerB(int y), in system/attackerB.c which works as follows.
The victim code remains the same, and the process running main() spawns three app
processes followed by the attacker process as in 4.2. When the attacker process run
attackerB(), its goal is three-fold. First, as in 4.2, make ctxsw() jump to malware code,
in this instance, void quietmalware(void), in system/quietmalware.c. Second, the code of
quietmalware() finds out the address of the local variable x of victimA() and modifies
its value from 5 to 9. Third, after quietmalware() is finished it jumps to the
instruction of resched() that ctxsw() would have returned to. The victim process
returns from resched() to sleepms() which returns to victimA() and outputs the
second kprintf(). The victim process seems to execute normally except for the value of
the local variable x having changed to 9.
A victim that does not know what the correct value of x should be will be unaware
that it has been corrupted. Explain in Lab4Answers.pdf your method for accomplishing
the second and third goals. For Problem 4.3, add the option
-fno-omit-frame-pointer in Makefile which forces gcc to use ebp as frame pointer.
By default, gcc tries to optimize by freeing up ebp to hold other values. Test and
verify that the attacker code works correctly.
</p>

<h2>Bonus problem [20 pts]</h2>

<p>
In Problem 3, the possibility exists that processes are blocked trying to send
to a receiver, but the receiver terminates without reading all messages. That is,
one or more processes are queued in the receiver's blocked sender queue when
it undergoes termination. One approach is to dequeue such processes, insert them
into XINU's ready list, and have bsend() return SYSERR. Describe a solution
in Lab4Answers.pdf that follows this approach and is backward compatible with
the solution of Problem 3. No need to implement the solution, but the description
should be sufficiently detailed.
That is, all kernel functions and data structures
that are required to be modified should be listed and the changes needed specified.
</p>

<p>

Note: The bonus problem provides an opportunity to earn extra credits that
count toward the lab component of the course. It is purely optional.

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>

<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>

<p>
If you are unsure what you need to submit in what format, consult the
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sashutos/ta-notes.html">TA Notes</a> link.
If it doesn't answer your question, send email to all four GTAs.
</p>

<p>
Specific instructions:
</p>

<p>
1. Format for submitting written lab answers and kprintf() added for 
testing and debugging purposes in kernel code:
</p><ul>
<li>
Provide your answers to the questions below in Lab4Answers.pdf and
place the file in lab4/. You may use any document editing software
but your final output must be exported and submitted as a pdf file.
</li>
<li>
For problems where you are asked to print values using kprintf(), use
conditional compilation (C preprocessor directives #define combined with #if and #endif)
with macro XINUTEST (in include/process.h) to effect
print/no print depending on if
XINUTEST is defined or not. For your debug statements, do the same with macro XINUDEBUG.
