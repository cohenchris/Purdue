<h2>3. Dynamical behavior of XINU's process scheduler [60 pts]</h2>

<h3>3.1 Background</h3>

<p>
We noted in class that XINU's scheduler picks a highest ready process to allocate CPU cycles
next. If there is a tie, the highest priority ready 
processes are serviced in a round-robin manner with
each process getting a fixed time budget, called time slice or quantum, to execute.
The kernel enforces the time budget by utilizing one of our x86 backend's clocks as its 
system timer to generate periodic interrupts every 1 msec.
The clock interrupt is mapped to interrupt number 32 in XINU through kernel initialization
functions set_evec() in clkinit() in system/.
The address of the clock interrupt handling code, clkdisp() in clkdisp.S, is installed
in IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) at its 33 entry (i.e., row) as noted in class.
The clock interrupt handling function clkdisp() to which the CPU jumps to after executing
the current instruction performs three tasks: (i) save the state of the current process
such as the values in some registers and the return address to jump to when interrupt handling
(which borrows the current process context), (ii) issue an EOI (end-of-interrupt) command
to PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) which assists the CPU with interrupt managing chores
to allow new clock interrupts to be generated, and (iii)
call clkhandler() in clkhandler.c which performs the main chores associated with
clock interrupt handling. That is (i) and (ii), although essential, are routine bookkeeping
tasks that must be performed so that the main tasks of (iii) can be
performed. Task (i) also includes disabling/enabling interrupts through cli/sti which
is noted in Section 5.4.
</p>

<p>
One of the tasks performed by clkhandler() is to determine if the current process 
has exceeded its time budget. If so, a call to XINU's process scheduler, resched() in resched.c,
is made to determine if the current process should continue to occupy the CPU after
clock interrupt handling is completed. By the scheduling rule discussed in class, if the
priority of the current process is strictly higher than that of all other ready processes, then
it continues to run. Otherwise, it will be context-switched out and a different process
becomes current, i.e., occupies the CPU.
When a ready process is selected to run next, the global variable <em>preempt</em> is
initialized to the constant QUANTUM which represents the time budget. Since XINU's clock interrupt is
configured to trigger every 1 msec and QUANTUM (in unit of msec) may be configured to
be greater than 1 msec, clkhandler() decrements preempt and calls resched()
when preempt reaches 0. That is, the current process has depleted its time budget.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Experiments</h3>

<p>
Find where the time budget QUANTUM is defined, note its value (put in comment the previous value 
out so that you keep a history), and change 
QUANTUM to 30 msec for the experiments below. When making changes to kernel code, annote the
code by specifying who (use your username), when (date), and why (be brief but try to be
informative). Make your lab1 XINU code that includes minor modifications to XINU
your baseline code for lab2. That includes creating a process to execute main()
from nulluser() directly using rcreate() without creating a process running 
startup(). Perform the following tasks and experiments:
</p>

<p>
(a) Remove the legacy code of main(). Change main() so that the example
code from Presentation-1.pdf, main() creating/resuming two processing running sndch()
printing 'A' and 'B', respectively,
are added. Replace putc() with kprintf().
Change their priorities from 20 to 10.
Check what the constant INITPRIO is which determines the
priority of the process executing main(). Compile, load, and run XINU
on a backend. What output to CONSOLE do you observe? Discuss your finding
in Lab2Answers.pdf in lab2/.
</p>

<p>
(b) Rerun experiment (a) with
QUANTUM set to 5 msec. Discuss your finding.
</p>

<p>
(c) Go back to the set-up of experiment (a) and change the priority of the process printing
'B' to 15. Discuss your finding.
</p>

<p>
(d) Go back to the set-up of experiment (a) and change the priority of the process printing
'A' to 25. Discuss your finding.
</p>

<p>
(e) Go back to the set-up of experiment (a) and change the priority of the process printing
'A' to 20. Discuss your finding. Explain the difference between (d) and (e).
</p>

<p>
(f) The system call create() does not allow creating a process whose
priority value is 0 or negative (verify the source code create.c). For example, if -3 is
given as the third argument, create() will return SYSERR. To varying extent all 
operating systems have vulnerabilities and XINU is no exception. Although create()
prevents 0 or negative priority values, after a process has been created with a positive
priority value the system call chprio() can be used to bypass this protection.
chprio() has two arguments: the first specifies a PID and the second a priority value
to change PID's priority to. Although chprio() checks that the first argument is a
valid process ID, it does not check whether the second argument is positive.
Modify XINU's chprio() so that it returns SYSERR when 0 or a negative priority value is
passed as argument. Test that the modified chprio() works correctly and make
it the default version for lab2 and future labs. Explain why this modification is
necessary to preserve an important property of the NULL process (or IDLE process
in Linux/UNIX and Windows) in today's operating systems.
</p>

<p>
Each experiment need only be run for a few seconds to gauge what is going on. Use
control-spacebar to return the backend to command-mode followed by power cycle and quit
(see <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs354/xinu/xinu-setup.html">XINU setup</a>) to release it.
</p>

<hr width="100%">
<h2>4. Kernel mod: adding new system calls [40 pts]</h2>

<p>
(a) Create a new system call, pid32 getppid(pid32), that allows a process to 
query the PID of the parent of the process given by the argument. When inspecting
system call create(), we find that the parent's PID of the new process to be spawned
is stored in the process table field prparent.
Follow the sanity check of chprio() to verify that the PID passed in the argument
is valid. If not, return SYSERR. Place the code of getppid() in getppid.c under
system/. Always start XINU system calls by
disabling interrupts by calling disable() and restoring interrupts
by calling restore(). 
Perform tests to check that getppid() works correctly.
</p>

<p>
(b) Create a new system call, uint32 gettmslice(void), that allows a process to 
check how much time (in unit of msec) remains in its time slice. Put the code of
gettmslice() in gettmslice.c under system/. Follow the same general convention as
getppid() in Problem 4(a) when coding XINU system calls. Check that your
system call works correctly.
</p>

<hr width="100%">
<h2>5. Trapped XINU system calls [120 pts]</h2>

<p>
In XINU, system calls are just regular C function calls that do not trap to kernel code
using a special trap instruction. In traditional x86 system call implementation 
in Linux/UNIX and Windows using <i>int</i> as the trap instruction, the convention has
been to provide the interrupt number as the operand of opcode int. For example, Linux
uses interrupt number 128 and Windows uses 46. The interrupt handling code that resides
at the specified interrupt number is called system call dispatcher code whose job 
is to make a jump to the kernel code that performs the tasks of the invoked system
call. When executing int,
we use register EAX to specify which system call should be invoked by the dispatcher.
Hence we need to store an integer, called system call number, in EAX before executing int.
The system calls getpid() and getprio() return the PID of the current process and the
priority of the process specified in the argument, respectively.
We will re-implement the two system calls so that they are not plain C function calls
as in legacy XINU, but use x86's software interrupt mechanism to trap to kernel code 
similar to how system calls are implemented in Linux/UNIX and Windows. 
</p>

<h3>5.1 System call dispatcher code </h3>

<p>
We will use the address already installed by XINU in IDT at interrupt number 
(i.e., table entry) 33, _Xint33, as the system call dispatch entry.
Thus the operand of instruction int when used for system call trap
will be always be 33. We choose 33 since 0-31 are reserved in x86 for specific synchronous 
interrupts called exceptions or faults, and XINU uses interrupt number 32 to handle clock (i.e.,
system timer) interrupts. XINU chooses to install 48 function pointers in IDT during
initialization by calling initevec() from sysinit() in initialize.c. XINU installs
the clock interrupt handler, clkdisp(),
in clkinit() by calling set_evec() with the first argument (interrupt number) set to
32 (constant IRQBASE). Hence we use the next available interrupt number, 33, as
the IDT entry for the system call dispatcher _Xint33. You will modify the assembly code
at _Xint33 in intr.S which is tantamount to implementing the system call dispatcher.
We will assign system call number 4 to system call getpid() and
5 to getprio() which is communicated to _Xint33 through register EAX.
That is, before executing int with operand 33, we will store 4 or 5 in EAX to
specify which of the two system calls has been invoked by a process. All
other system call numbers will be invalid and must return -1 to indicate an error
has occurred. _Xint33 will inspect the value of EAX and conditionally call
getpid() or getprio().
</p>

<h3>5.2 System call wrapper function </h3>

<p>
In x86 Linux, a system call such as fork() is a wrapper function which contains a
trap instruction to jump to the system call dispatcher code inside the kernel using
the synchronous interrupt instruction int. The preferred option today is to use a
special trap instruction sysenter which optimizes upon int to reduce overhead.
In lab2, we will use the traditional method of trapping through int. We will implement
a wrapper function for getpid(), pid32 wgetpid(void), which has the same function
definition as getpid(). We will treat getpid() as an internal kernel function that
_Xint33 calls to handle the actual task of finding out the PID of the current process.
We will call the wrapper function of getprio(), syscall wgetprio(pid32), and follow
the same design rules as for getpid() by treating getprio() as the internal kernel
function that _Xint33 calls to change the priority of a process. Put the code of
wgetpid() and wgetprio() in wgetpid.c and wgetprio.c, respectively, in system/ coded
in C. Another option is to code the wrapper functions in assembly. We will avoid
coding in assembly unless necessary. Even though we code the wrapper functions in C,
we will need execute the int instruction with operand 33 and, before doing so,
assign the system call number (4 for getpid() and 5 for getprio()) in EAX. These
operations cannot be done using C. Instead, we will embed limited assembly code inside
the C wrapper functions by employing in-line assembly asm(). For example, in lab1,
Problem 3.4, to generate divide-by-zero interrupt which jumps to interrupt handling
code at _Xint0, instead of using C code such as x = x / y where y is 0, we could
have coded asm("int 0") which would have embedded assembly instruction "int 0" 
to generate synchronous interrupt 0.
</p>

<h3>5.3 Extended inline assembly</h3>

<p>
When using inline assembly to embed assembly code within C code, but for very simple
cases we require interface
operations such as copying C variable values (including constants) into x86
registers and copying register values into C variables. For example, we need to
store the system call number in EAX before executing "int $33" ($33 follows AT&amp;T syntax). 
Conversely,
after instruction "int $33" which is a jump to kernel code _Xint33 via IDT and
jumping back to the instruction following "int $33" after _Xint33 returns,
the return value of getpid() must be communicated back to its wrapper function
wgetpid(). Since CDECL in gcc puts the return value of a function in register
EAX, we need to copy the value of EAX to a C variable after executing "int $33".
Interfacing between C and embedded assembly code is facilitated by using extended
inline assembly which follows the format
<br><br>
asm(assembler template
<br>
   : output operands
<br>
   : input operands
<br>
   : clobbered registers);
<br><br>
The assembler template may contain an instruction to copy a C variable containing
the system call number into EAX, the
int instruction with the interrupt number 33 as operand, and an instruction to copy EAX 
containing the return value of a system call to a
C variable. In the case of system calls such as getprio() which has
an integer argument, we must communicate from wgetprio() to _Xint33 an integer value
which _Xint33, in turn, must pass to getprio() when it is called. When passing
an integer value from wgetprio() to _Xint33, you may do so by storing it in an unused
register, say EBX, or push the value onto the run-time stack of the current process.
Common practice is to use EBX if a system call has a single argument. Additional
registers (e.g., ECX, EDX) may be used for system calls with multiple arguments.
You are coding the extended inline assembly of wgetprio() and the assembly code
_Xint33, hence you have full freedom to choose what to do. In lab2, follow the practice
of using EBX to communicate a single system call argument.
</p>

<p>
When _Xint33 calls getprio(),
however, you must write assembly code at _Xint33 that is compatible with the CDECL
assembly code produced by gcc when translating getprio() in C. 
In our 32-bit x86 backend, gcc expects arguments to be
pushed onto the stack. Hence your code at _Xint33 must push the argument of
getprio() onto the stack before executing call getprio. When system calls have
multiple arguments, multiple values must be pushed in the right-to-left order onto
the stack (recall CDECL caller/callee convention review). 
In lab2, you only need to support zero or one argument system calls.
</p>

<p>
Last, but not least, registers EAX and EBX in the above examples are assumed to be
unused which may not be the case. For example, the C code of wgetprio()
preceding extended inline assembly when translated into assembly by gcc may be using
EAX to store some value. If so, hijacking EAX to communicate the system call number
to _Xint33 overwrites the previous value which may produce a run-time bug. 
Similarly for EBX.
Thus when interfacing between C and assembly code in extended inline assembly, it
is imperative that conflicts in the form of unintended overwrite of register values
are avoided. To do so, a list of potentially shared registers, called
clobbered registers, must be specified so that gcc can use this information when
generating assembly code to avoid conflicts.
</p>

<h3>5.4 What x86 int instruction does to the run-time stack </h3>

<p>
When we execute "int $33" through inline assembly in the wrapper function of a system
call, x86 hardware pushes EFLAGS, CS, and EIP onto the current process's run-time stack.
The content of EFLAGS is pushed so that it can be restored upon returning from interrupt handling.
CS and EIP are pushed so that x86 knows where to jump to when the interrupt handling
code executes iret to return from interrupt handling. Before iret is executed, the interrupt
handling code must ensure that ESP points to where EIP was stored on the stack. It is your
responsiblity to keep track of this information. iret then atomically
pops the stored EIP, CS, EFLAGS from the stack and loads the EIP, CS, EFLAGS registers
so that the interrupted process can resume where it left off. The entries of IDT can be
configured to automatically disable interrupts by setting their type as interrupt gate. 
In XINU, IDT entries are configured to not disable interrupts by setting their type
as trap gate. Thus it is your responsibility in the
code of _Xint33 to disable interrupts and ensure that while in the midst of performing
interrupt handling a new interrupt does not interrupt the interrupt handler which may
cause havoc by corrupting shared data structures. Good practice is to disable interrupts
by executing cli upon entry into _Xint33 and enable interrupts by executing sti before
executing iret to return from interrupt handling in _Xint33. The assembly code of the
clock dispatcher, clkdisp.S, is a useful example to consider. The only assistance provided
by x86 hardware support is atomic restoring of content in EFLAGS, CS, and EIP registers.
All other state of the interrupted process that may be affected by kernel
interrupt handling (i.e., _Xtrap33 and the kernel functions it calls) you must store
and restore so that run-time bugs do not arise. For example, storing/restoring general 
purpose registers using the pushal/popal is common practice. Unless you know for sure
that interrupt handling will not change the values of general purpose registers,
or that changing their values will not cause a problem. In general, this is not easy to
determine and a conservative approach that favors caution is recommended.
</p>

<h3>5.5 Implementation of trapped versions of getpid() and getprio()</h3>

<p>
The preceding subsections 5.1 - 5.4 provides the logical and technical background for
implementing the trapped versions of getpid(), getprio() systems through wrapper
functions wgetpid(), wgetprio(), and system call dispatch code _Xint33. Wrapper code
is C with extended inline assembly, and system call dispatch code is coded in assembly.
The knowledge and skills needed to coordinate the various software components to correctly
interface while utilizing underlying hardware support is referred to as 
ABI (application binary interface) programming. This is in contrast to API programming
which covers app programming and most of system programming, where making a computing system
do what we want it to do is less direct and limited in what can be done.
Implement the trapped versions of getpid(), getprio(), and verify that your modification of
the XINU kernel works correctly through careful testing. What to test and how to test are
part and parcel of software development. First look for the "low hanging fruit" which typically
do not require significant effort to identify. Then identify more subtle test cases that may
help reveal less obvious run-time bugs. Except in toy systems, there is, in general,
no such thing as a completely bug free software system including kernel code. All we can do
is build a system that works sufficiently reliably and efficiently for a target real-world
environment. The TAs will evaluate your implementation using their own test cases augmented
by checking your source code for content (i.e., technical approach such as disabling
interrupts or not) and style
(adequate comments including who/what/why annotation).

<h2><b>Turn-in instructions</b></h2>

<p>
General instructions:
</p>

<p>
When implementing code in the labs, please
maintain separate versions/copies of code so that mistakes such
as unintentional overwriting or deletion of code is prevented. 
This is in addition to the efficiency that such organization provides.
You may use any number of version control systems
such as GIT and RCS. Please make sure that your code is protected from public access. 
For example, when using GIT, use git that manages code locally instead of its
on-line counterpart github. If you prefer
not to use version control tools, you may
just use manual copy to keep track of different versions required for development
and testing. More vigilance and discipline may be required when doing so.
</p>

<p>
The TAs, when evaluating your code, will use their own test code (principally main())
to drive your XINU code. The code you put inside main() is for your own testing and will,
in general, not be considered during evaluation.
</p>
