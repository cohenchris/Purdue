First Verse:
To Your Call Once More We Rally;
Alma Mater Hear Our Praise.
Where The Wabash Spreads Its Valley;
Filled With Joy Our Voices Raise.
From The Skies In Swelling Echoes
Come The Cheers That Tell The Tale
Of Your Vict'ries And Your Heros,
Hail Purdue! We Sing All Hail!

(Chorus)
Hail, Hail To Old Purdue!
All Hail To Our Old Gold And Black!
Hail, Hail To Old Purdue!
Our Friendship May She Never Lack.
Ever Grateful, Ever True,
Thus We Raise Our Song Anew;
Of The Days We've Spent With You,
All Hail Our Own Purdue!

Second Verse:
When In After Years We're Turning,
Alma Mater, Back To You.
May Our Hearts With Love Be Yearning
For The Scenes Of Old Purdue.
Back Among Your Pathways Winding
Let Us Seek What Lies Before;
Fondest Hopes And Aims E'er Finding,
While We Sing Of Days Of Yore.

Third Verse:
Sung only by the band at special events
In the Band we March and Swagger
As we Play for Old Purdue
At the Halftime we do Shows
No other Band on Earth Could do
When we Cheer the Earth Will Tremble
For We're Known Throughout the Land
As the Best in Marching Music,
We're the Boilermaker Band.
